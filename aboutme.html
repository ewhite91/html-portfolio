    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Evan White and I am a student at Indiana State University. 
        I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics and am scheduled to graduate in May 2025. 
        I am also working towards a data science major and cyber security minor and am scheduled to receive them in May 2026. 
        As of now, I am working on some projects in Python, such as a connect four style game.  
        Outside of school, I try to stay active and exercise.
